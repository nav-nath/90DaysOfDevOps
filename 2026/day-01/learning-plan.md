I am Production Support Professional.
I want to learn and grow in DevOps and Cloud.
As I am new to DevopsI want to learn DevOps tools like Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, Shell Scripting and Cloud (AWS).
My understanding of DevOps, it is not just a job or role. It's things doing fast, realible solutions and manage scalable infrastructure.
For that, I'll allocate a time of 5-6 hours weekly for study and assignments.
My goal of attending this course is a get job in DevOps or move in next level in my current organisation.
